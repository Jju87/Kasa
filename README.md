### Scenarios

As part of my training, I was tasked with redesigning the Kasa website. The scenario provided was that Kasa was undergoing a major redesign effort, transitioning from legacy ASP.NET to a modern JavaScript stack with NodeJS on the backend and React on the frontend. The goal was to create a responsive website following design mockups provided by the freelance designer, Paul.

### Technologies Used

-   **Frontend:** React
-   **Styling:** Sass
-   **Animation:** CSS animations
-   **Routing:** React Router

### Key Features Implemented

-   **Responsive Design:** Ensured that the website is responsive and renders correctly on various devices and screen sizes.
-   **React Components:** Developed reusable React components for building the website's UI, including navigation, property listings, and gallery components.
-   **React Routing:** Implemented React Router to manage navigation between different pages of the website.
-   **Collapse Component:** Implemented a Collapse component with CSS animations as specified by the designer. This component was used for dropdown menus throughout the website.
