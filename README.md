## Overview

Welcome to the Kasa Website Redesign Project! This repository contains the code for the redesigned website for Kasa, a leading platform for peer-to-peer apartment rentals in France. The project involved a complete overhaul of the existing website to improve user experience, modernize the technology stack, and implement new features.

## Project Details

### Scenarios

As part of my web development training, I was tasked with redesigning the Kasa website. The scenario provided was that Kasa was undergoing a major redesign effort, transitioning from legacy ASP.NET to a modern JavaScript stack with NodeJS on the backend and React on the frontend. The goal was to create a responsive website following design mockups provided by the freelance designer, Paul.

### Technologies Used

-   **Frontend:** React
-   **Styling:** Sass
-   **Animation:** CSS animations
-   **Routing:** React Router

### Key Features Implemented

-   **Responsive Design:** Ensured that the website is responsive and renders correctly on various devices and screen sizes.
-   **React Components:** Developed reusable React components for building the website's UI, including navigation, property listings, and gallery components.

-   **React Routing:** Implemented React Router to manage navigation between different pages of the website.

-   **Collapse Component:** Implemented a Collapse component with CSS animations as specified by the designer. This component was used for dropdown menus throughout the website.

### Animations

CSS animations were used to enhance the user experience, particularly for the Collapse component and other interactive elements.

## Getting Started

To view the website locally:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the development server using `npm start`.
5. Access the website in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Design Mockups

Design mockups were provided in Figma by the freelance designer. The prototypes were used to ensure accurate implementation of the website's design.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable hands-on experience in developing a real-world website using modern web technologies. I learned how to translate design mockups into interactive web pages, implement responsive designs, and utilize React for building dynamic user interfaces.
